 <p style=" font-size: 24px; text-align: center;"> My one and only love, first of all i am really sorry for the delay baby. I know you must have felt that i didnt care<br>
 about it or even that im loving my feelings towards you, but it was seriously never the case.</p>
  
  <p style=" font-size: 24px; text-align: center;"> You are everything to me and you deserve to get a gift on time, but unfortunately things didnt go as i planned it.<br>
And i feel really bad for not being able to be there to hand you this gift myself.</p>

 <p style=" font-size: 24px; text-align: center;"> I MISS YOU VERRYYY MUCH BABY, and i know you do too. But dont worry bby i will be back soon and we will spend plenty of time together. Another thing , Dont overthink abt me i will always be there with you. My love for you grows stronger and stronger every day and it will neve ever fade away.</p>
